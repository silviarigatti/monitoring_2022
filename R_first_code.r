# This is my first code in github! Quite exciting, right?

# Here are the input data
# Costanza data on streams
water <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
water

# Marta data on fishes genomes
fishes <- c(10, 50, 60, 100, 200)
fishes

# plot the diversity of fishes (y) versus the amount of water (x)
plot(water, fishes)
